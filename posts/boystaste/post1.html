        <h1 id="top-title">Why I think Pantyhose and Stockings are both superior</h1>
        <p id="subheading">The superior clothes that makes a beautiful woman ~</p>
        <p id="date-and-time">10:46 PM – 28/6/2022</p>
        <p>This is probably one of the most popular fetishes amongst men and male adolescents: Pantyhose. Its texture, its blackness, the way it emphasizes the woman’s lower part of the body,… everything is just Perfecto. </p>
        <p>As far as I am concerned, there’s an ongoing war between those who prefer Pantyhose and those who are into Stockings, to decide whether which of them makes a woman more appealing. So today, I am going to share my thoughts specifically on this topic. However, keep in mind that my opinions do not reflects all men’s preference, it might be biased and one-sided, but I’ll make it as objective as possible.</p>
        <h2>1. The tightness </h2>
        <p>Both of Pantyhose and Stockings are capable of having this attribute, and this will be even more powerful if you have big thighs/buttocks. To have a clearer visualisation, let’s compare these pictures down below:</p>
        <p>Arts in Anime:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../../img/fig1.png" alt="Miru Tights" style="width: 100%;">
        </figure>
        <p>(Fig 1: Miru Tights – an anime about girls who like to wear Pantyhose)</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../../img/fig2.png" alt="Koharu-chan" style="width: 100%;">
        </figure>
        <p>(Fig2: Koharu-chan from Osananajimi de Koibito no Kanojo to Shitai Koto Zenbu)</p>
        <p>Now, what’s the thing that these two pictures have in common? That’s right, lower body emphasis. Emphasizing the most beautiful part of a woman’s body makes is the key to being attractive towards other people. It can be seen that the lower parts of those who wear Pantyhose are fully black, making it the “spotlight” of one’s outfit. On the other hand, Stockings also have the change of the color, from their skin color to the color of the Stockings. That color contradiction, as well as its tightness is the core of the spectacular look of this character (or anyone who wears it in general). As a man, I can probably assume that both of these choices of clothes are extremely decent. Not only those are highly fashionable (and sometimes even turn guys on XD), but they are also very formal, therefore appropriate for office uniforms and suitable for dating occasions.</p>
        <p>However, arts and fictional things above are a little bit surreal and sometimes even not accurate when compared to the real world, so let’s have a closer look at some of the real models with real outfits too. </p>
        <p>In real life:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../../img/fig3.jpg" alt="Woman wearing pantyhose" style="width: 100%;">

        </figure>
        <p>(Fig4: A person who’s wearing Stockings – source: Unknown)</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, the same effects that I mentioned above turns out to be also true for the real world! Those create that smoothness to the legs of the wearer. </p>
        <h2>2. The number of Denier of the Hosiery</h2>
        <p>For those of you who don’t know the unit “Denier”, it’s basically the transparency of the hosiery that you are wearing. The higher the Denier value, the less transparent it will be. Personally, I believe regardless of it being Stockings or Pantyhose, opacity really is a significant factor that decides the score of attractiveness. Not only it makes your whole legs opaque (therefore making it mysterious for those who look at, and creating an illusion of wanting to discover what’s behind that non-transparency), it also hides your flaws such as scratches or marks, so that the wearer can be fully confident about their appearance.  </p>
        <p>According to wikihow:</p>
        <p>a. 15 denier or less is defined as “ultrasheer”, so the hosiery will be very transparent. In other words, it’s like wearing nothing at all, therefore very suitable for hot weather during the summer. The only bad thing about this opacity level is, scratches of the Pantyhose or Stockings will be easily spotted, so the wearer have to be super careful, in order to preserve its smooth condition. Nonetheless, if we don’t take into account the suitability for wearing in the workspace, it’s even more……sexy (since it’s a little bit ripped, illusion of wanting to discover what’s behind that hosiery will be even more powerful.). Personally, I would say effect this only applies (and only should be applied) to Pantyhose, because if you think about it closely, ripped Stockings aren’t that nice to wear, thus even wearing nothing is better than that. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../../img/fig5.png" alt="Ripped Pantyhose" style="width: 100%;">
        </figure>
        <p>(Fig 5: Ripped Pantyhose. Source: <a href="https://www.123rf.com/photo_153636921_beautiful-girl-in-ripped-black-nylon-pantyhose-.html?vti=n3c2cogi2b7v9txtw4-1-13">https://www.123rf.com/photo_153636921_beautiful-girl-in-ripped-black-nylon-pantyhose-.html?vti=n3c2cogi2b7v9txtw4-1-13</a>)</p>
        <p>b. 15 to 30 denier is considered “sheer” (A.K.A the standard level of the hosiery). Your skin will still be visible to the human eye, while keeping the dark color of it. This denier range is very classic and common and woman will most likely to find this while shopping for hosiery.</p>
        <p>c. 30 denier and above: It will definitely look like Fig 3 above, very mysterious isn’t it. Although your skin will not be visible with this opacity, it’s very good for keeping your legs warm, especially in the winter. However, that also means it’s going to be very hot (I’m just assuming because I haven’t worn one before) to wear this during the summer, so the two ranges of denier would likely to be chosen specifically for that hot time of the year. Nevertheless, the opaquer it gets, the more appealing it becomes. </p>
        <h2>3. You get to rip off the Pantyhose before having “seggs” </h2>
        <p>(Fact: Pantyhose is highly underrated in…..Hentai. But if a Hentai has Pantyhose in it, it’s definitely going to be good :] )</p>
        <p>So, it’s time you knew that I, a normal male human being, am into pornography (ero-anime specifically). I’ve seen thousands and thousands of hentai before, and I have to say most of them only consist of Stockings. While that might mean Stockings is overall a fetish that more people are interested in, Pantyhose is still a very viable choice to go for, but sadly there are fewer hentai that specialise in this hosiery when compared to Stockings. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../../img/fig6.png" alt="hentai pantyhose" style="width: 100%;">
        </figure>
        <p>(Fig 6: Pantyhose in hentai. Source (think before you click): <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/89410170">https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/89410170)</a> </p>
        <p>Now, the THIRD reason why I myself prefer Pantyhose over Stockings (in pornography and such), is because the main character (usually a man) who’s about to have “seggs”, gets to rip the Pantyhose off for his “main course” as if he were opening a present for himself in Christmas. On the other hand, Stockings are just like long socks, so you basically cannot do the same thing as you do with Pantyhose, unfortunately. I know this is just me expressing my fetish and my sexual desire, but I am pretty sure all other men like the feeling of ripping off the Pantyhose of their lovers when having “seggs”, so I am actually not an outlier in this case. </p>
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>In this post we’ve discussed 3 reasons why I believe any kinds of hosiery is superior. It’s worth mentioning that this is not a scientifically proof of why I think hosieries are sexy. There is, however, a good video about scientifically proving that Stockings is better that thighhighs. You can watch it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5jQeABTtY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5jQeABTtY</a> </p>
        <p>Regardless of my biased opinion, Pantyhose and Stockings are, and will always be, the choice of clothes that specifically turns men (possibly even women) on. </p>
        <p>Note: I am truly sorry for researching my own fetish and publish it as a post, but I guess putting some time into something that is enjoyable is absolutely not wholly meaningless. I sincerely hope no girls will throw up and feel disgusted about everything I said today….</p>
        <p>But still, I have my own rights to like what I like, even if it’s overly gross like this. Respecting fetishes IS the ground rule ~</p>
